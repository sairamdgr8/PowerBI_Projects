Vibhor,Singh,Self employed,Web Developer,"""Ridiculously efficient"" is what comes to mind when I talk about Sairam. Other than his obvious zeal for excellence, his nature of making friends out of the people he works with him is what I like the best. It was a pleasure getting to work with him and know about his love for the actor Pawan Kalyan. Given the opportunity I would have him in my team again.","02/08/21, 07:18 AM",VISIBLE
